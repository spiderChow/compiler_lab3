Project Name: Semantic Analysis

NOTICE: COPY FROM OTHERS WILL BOTH GET ZERO!


Project Specification: 
  Please See PROGRAM Section, Chapter Five, Modern Compiler Implementation in C.
  (Page 103 to 124 for English Version, Page Youknow for Chinese Version.:))

Due Date: November. 24th, 2017

Submission to ftp://10.132.141.33/classes/14/ ......./WORK_UPLOAD/lab3

You should all use the same format: 
First put all the files you need to submit in the project-3 directory named by your student 
number, e.g. 14302010001.
Second come to the parent directory of 14302010001, and use the following command
"tar cvf 14302010001.tar 14302010001" to compress it to 14302010001.tar.


Note: 
Compiling Error means Zero Point. Standard Test Platform is Linux version 2.6.32-5-amd64 (Debian 2.6.32-31).
Make sure that your output is the same as reference output.

TODO
implement env.h and env.c 

semant.h: 
void SEM_transProg(A_exp exp);

implement semant.c 
        The four recursive functions
        void  SEM_trnasProg(A_exp exp);

that type checks exp.
        Handle recursive and mutually recursive declarations.
        Check that a "break" is within a "for" or "while"
        Illegal cycles in type declaration  

implement a main() (in parse.c) that: 
        calls the parser
        calls the function SEM_transProg()
